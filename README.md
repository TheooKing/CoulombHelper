# CoulombHelper
A little fun helper for the law of coulomb made in python

Work with the point charges that affect each other.
Algorithm created using vectors.

If you want to only use the backend, you can copy both files config.py and coulomb.py.

Pygame Visualizer soon... (with the help of my lovely game engine [TLengPy2](https://github.com/theolaos/TLengPy2))
